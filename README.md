## Data Science Workflows Using Docker Containers

### Description

Jupyter notebooks make it easy to create reproducible workflows that can be distributed across groups and organizations. This is a simple process provided that our end-users have access to the data along with a compatible Python environment. Learn how to use Docker to package a shareable image containing the libraries, code, and data required to reproduce every calculation.

### Abstract

Containerization technologies such as Docker enable software to run across various computing environments. Data Science requires auditable workflows where we can easily share and reproduce results. Docker is a useful tool that we can use to package libraries, code, and data into a single image.
This tutorial will cover the basics of Docker; discuss how containers fit into Data Science workflows; and provide a quick-start guide that can be used as a template to create a shareable Docker image!
Learn how to leverage the power of Docker without having to worry about the underlying details of the technology.
